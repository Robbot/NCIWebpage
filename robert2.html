  <p>Following World War II, most breweries were nationalized under the communist regime. After the collapse of the communist regime, a market economy was introduced, international beer companies moved in and a period of consolidation followed. Three companies now control 80% of the Polish beer market (according to data at the end of 2014). At the end of 2013, there were 97 breweries in Poland, including microbreweries and contracted breweries. The most popular Polish beers are Żywiec, Okocim and Tyskie.</p>
